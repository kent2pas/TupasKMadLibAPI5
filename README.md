//Peer Review Carlos Felipe This program works very very well I'm surprised at the technical ability of the owner. It amazes me what they can do with a computer 
and a few lines of code. Absolutely speechless. Good job!


Download Appications and Download Code: You need the following appications postman and visual studio code. All must be login or setup before proceding To download my code
there should be a green button that says code on it. Then copy it and open up visual studio code. Open a new window and click on Clone git Repository. Then paste the link
in the URL. Make a new folder where you want to put it.

Run the code: You run a Debug then your default browser should pop up a window. It should say localhost can't be found. On top copy the URL then. Go on postman and click
on workspace in the URL put the URL you copy from the localhost in the URL. It should look like this https://localhost:7002/. Go back on visual studio code click on the 
contoller folder. Look at the names click on SayHelloController.cs. By public class copy only "madlib" ignoring Contoller.cs. Go back on postman and paste it in the URL.
It should look like this https://localhost:7002/madlib. Go back on visual studio code on the madlibController.cs. You should see [HttpGet] and under it 
[Route("madlib/{name}/{adj1}/{adj2}/{adj3}/{adj4}/{adj5}/{verbswithing1}/{verbswithing2}/{verbswithing3}")]. Copy the text in the quotions marks. 
Go back on postman and paste what you copy in the URL. Get rid of {name},{adj1},{adj2},{adj3},{adj4},{adj5},{verbswithing1},{verbswithing2},{verbswithing3}
and type in adjectives and verbs ending with -ing. It should look like this 
https://localhost:7002/madlib/madlib/Kent/tired/bright/huge/strange/great/running/jumping/walking.
